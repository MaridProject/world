# Introduction

We used to think that our World is big. We even sometimes think it is endless. Here you'll find an imaginary experiment of what our World could be.

# Infinity

Let's imagine an unlimited sequence of random binary numbers `{...,N(i-1), Ni, N(i+1),..., }`. We could describe this stochastic process as a line of 1's and 0's. We could see it as a plane considering all even indices as X coordinates and all odd indices as Y coordinates. So, we could produce 2D, 3D, 4D, ... sequences and they also will be unlimited or infinite.
