# Introduction

We used to think that our World is big. We even sometimes think it is endless. Here you'll find an imaginary experiment of what our World could be.

# Infinity

Let's imagine an unlimited sequence of random binary numbers `{...,N(i-1), Ni, N(i+1),..., }`. We could describe this stochastic process as a line of 1's and 0's. We could see it as a plane considering all even indices as X coordinates and all odd indices as Y coordinates. So, we could produce 2D, 3D, 4D, ... sequences and they also will be unlimited or infinite.

# Movement

Please look at this picture:
```
1st frame
1 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
0 | 0 | 1

2nd frame
0 | 0 | 0
1 | 1 | 1
0 | 0 | 0

3rd frame
0 | 0 | 1
0 | 1 | 0
1 | 0 | 0

4th frame
0 | 1 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
```

Considering an infinite number of numbers in each dimension, we'll get an infinite number of pieces like the 1st frame, an infinite number of pieces like the 2nd frame and so on. Moreover, we'll get an infinite number of all horizontally or vertically connected frames.

If you connect all these frames in your mind, you'll get a rotating pipe.
