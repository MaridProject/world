# Introduction

We used to think that our World is big. We even sometimes think it is endless. Here you'll find an imaginary experiment of what our World could be.

# Infinity

Let's imagine an unlimited sequence of random binary numbers `{...,N(i-1), Ni, N(i+1),..., }`. Let's name it as Universe. We could describe this stochastic process as a line of 1's and 0's. We could see it as a plane considering all even indices as X coordinates and all odd indices as Y coordinates. So, we could produce 2D, 3D, 4D, ... sequences and they also will be unlimited or infinite.

# Movement

Please look at this picture:
```
1st frame
1 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
0 | 0 | 1

2nd frame
0 | 0 | 0
1 | 1 | 1
0 | 0 | 0

3rd frame
0 | 0 | 1
0 | 1 | 0
1 | 0 | 0

4th frame
0 | 1 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
```

Considering an infinite number of numbers in each dimension, we'll get an infinite number of pieces like the 1st frame, an infinite number of pieces like the 2nd frame and so on. Moreover, we'll get an infinite number of all horizontally or vertically connected frames.

If you connect all these frames in your mind, you'll get a rotating pipe.

# The complexity

If we have an infinity of all english words mixed in some container, we'll have also an infinite number of sequences of them so that each sequence become the Romeo and Juliet.

But this kind of complexity is a simple puzzle unless... 

# Life

Any complex object you can imagine could be represented by some N-dimensional piece of the sequence above. As far as the sequence is infinite, there are infinte instances of such objects.

But what if some instances have a memory? In sense that each of them can memorize some amount of information (1's and 0's) with some errors or incompleteness but sufficient to say that this one had been a previous state and this one was the current. The environment of that creature must be relatively predicatable in sense that its awareness couldn't point some randomly selected piece of the Universe, but some random piece that is "relatively connected" to the memory.

When a poet writes some poem, he/she writes the words from some set of words in some order, but being shuffled these words are not more than a meaningless set of words. There is not any God's Providence here: there is a simple probability that some world exists, it has creatures with memory and conscience in sense that they can represent some amount of information around them as a current state understanding this as a current reality, can memorize "these realities" with some level of error and incompleteness buf it's sufficient to them to say that it is their life.

1. When a creature see something, it's supposed to be probable; since it's probable, it exists
2. When a creature memorize something, it's supposed to be probable; since it's probable, it exists
3. A conscience is a way to connect the previous memorized state to the current one, to found the changes and to try to make predictions. So, the probability that that kind of creatures exists is related to an ability of deducing rules justifying the existence per se. There's no evolution here as a matter of Life: such Life is a matter of the evolution.

# The rule of Probability

A probability of something results in the existence of it, including the most complex cases.
Any complex object is real in the random Universe, it simply exists.
If there is a creature (as a random piece of the Universe) with a memory and conscience, it already invented rules of its own universe. So, the conscience cannot be separated from the rules of the subjective universe. A conscience and memory exist, so  there exist also some rules to justify all around. Thanks to rules, the mind of such creature selects only those parts of the Universe that "relatively conform" to that rules. The creature cannot exist in a world with other rules only because it would be another creature.
